# HestiaClaw

**Hestia** is a self-hosted smart home AI assistant built around Home Assistant. She runs entirely on your own infrastructure — no cloud middleman, no subscription, no data leaving your server unless you choose it. Talk to her in the browser, ask about your home, trigger automations, and watch her build a persistent memory of your world through a live 3D knowledge graph.

Under the hood: a React + Vite frontend, an Express agent harness, real-time token streaming, a layered memory system (pinned facts + Graphiti long-term graph), MCP tool support, voice I/O, and a skills system for custom behaviors.

---

## Features

- **Native agent harness** — built-in agent loop with multi-provider LLM support: Anthropic Claude, OpenAI / GPT, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (Ollama, LM Studio, etc.)
- **Home Assistant integration** — 87+ HA tools via ha-mcp; control devices, query entities, trigger automations, and check states directly from chat
- **HA Assist voice integration** — connect Home Assistant's Assist voice pipeline directly to Hestia via the [webhook-conversation](https://github.com/eulemitkeule/webhook-conversation) integration; voice sessions appear in the sidebar alongside regular chats
- **Layered memory system** — pinned facts file (`MEMORY.md`) + per-turn Graphiti recall + long-term knowledge graph; memories are promoted, consolidated, and pruned automatically each night
- **MCP tool support** — connect any MCP server in `agent.config.json`; tools are auto-registered and immediately available to the LLM
- **Skills system** — drop `SKILL.md` files into `skills/` to define custom agent behaviors; invoke with `/skill-name` or let the model pick them up automatically
- **3D knowledge graph** — full-screen force-directed visualization of the Graphiti/Neo4j memory graph, with community coloring, degree sizing, and one-click GDS recompute
- **Runtime provider & model switching** — swap between Anthropic and OpenAI and pick any model from a live-fetched dropdown without restarting the server; settings persist across restarts
- **Agent diagnostics panel** — inspect provider, MCP server health, tool metadata, skills, and fully traced recent runs
- **Harness controls** — browser-mediated approvals for risky tools, bounded context compaction, session forking; toggle approvals with `/approvals` in chat
- **Real-time streaming** — responses appear token-by-token; tool call badges show which tools fired and when
- **Voice I/O** — hold to speak (ElevenLabs realtime STT), spoken replies after mic-originated turns (ElevenLabs TTS)
- **Thinking animation** — rotating rings, hex grid, pulsing core while the agent is thinking; shows active tool name live
- **Multi-conversation sidebar** — persistent conversation history sorted by recency, create / switch / delete / search sessions
- **Markdown + syntax highlighting** — GFM rendering, auto-fenced code blocks, Prism highlighting with copy button

## Quickstart

The full stack — Neo4j, Graphiti MCP, ha-mcp, and Hestia — starts with one command.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cl0ud6uru/HestiaClaw
cd HestiaClaw

cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set SESSION_SECRET, BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD, OPENAI_API_KEY,
# NEO4J_PASSWORD, HA_URL, and HA_TOKEN at minimum

cp agent.config.example.json agent.config.json
# Edit agent.config.json — set your provider, model, and system prompt

docker compose up -d
```

App runs at **http://localhost:3001** · Neo4j browser at **http://localhost:7474**

> **Note:** Two extra files — `graphiti_mcp_server.py` and `graphiti_config.yaml` — must exist in the project root before running `docker compose up`. They patch the Graphiti container to accept cross-container connections and write memory to Neo4j instead of its embedded FalkorDB. Copy them from a running `zepai/knowledge-graph-mcp` instance or see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for details.

### `agent.config.json`

The agent harness activates when this file is present. Copy the example and customize:

```bash
cp agent.config.example.json agent.config.json
```

```json
{
  "provider": {
    "type": "openai",
    "model": "gpt-5.4-mini"
  },
  "systemPrompt": "You are Hestia, a smart home AI assistant...",
  "harness": {
    "approvals": true,
    "approvalTimeoutMs": 60000,
    "compactionEnabled": true,
    "contextMaxMessages": 40
  },
  "mcpServers": {
    "home-assistant": {
      "url": "http://ha-mcp:8086/mcp"
    },
    "graphiti": {
      "url": "http://graphiti:8000/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

**Supported providers:**

| `type` | Model examples | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `anthropic` | `claude-opus-4-7`, `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| `openai` | `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.4-mini`, `gpt-5.4-nano` | Requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`; set `OPENAI_BASE_URL` for local models |

**MCP servers** support both stdio configs (`command`/`args`) and remote HTTP configs (`url`). `${VAR}` references in `env` and `headers` blocks expand from the environment at startup.

All settings changed through the Agent Harness panel (provider, model, system prompt, context window, etc.) are written back to `agent.config.json` automatically and persist across container restarts.

## Home Assistant Assist Integration

Hestia can serve as the AI backend for Home Assistant's Assist voice pipeline via the [webhook-conversation](https://github.com/eulemitkeule/webhook-conversation) custom integration. Voice commands spoken to an HA voice satellite (e.g. a Voice PE device) are routed through Hestia's full agent harness — including MCP tools, long-term memory, and entity awareness.

### Setup

1. Install the **Webhook Conversation** integration in Home Assistant (HACS → Custom repositories → `eulemitkeule/webhook-conversation`)

2. Add a new **Conversation agent** in the integration and configure it:

   | Field | Value |
   |---|---|
   | **Webhook URL** | `https://your-hestia-domain/api/webhook/conversation` |
   | **Authentication** | Basic HTTP authentication |
   | **Username** | anything (e.g. `hestia`) — not validated |
   | **Password** | value of `WEBHOOK_SECRET` in your `.env` |
   | **Output field name** | `output` |

3. Generate a secure webhook secret:
   ```bash
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```
   Set it as `WEBHOOK_SECRET` in `.env` and restart the container.

4. In Home Assistant → **Settings → Voice assistants**, select your new Hestia conversation agent.

### How it works

- Each HA voice conversation uses its own `conversation_id`, which maps to a dedicated thread in the HestiaClaw sidebar — browse past voice sessions just like regular chat sessions
- HA's list of exposed entities (with entity IDs, names, states, and areas) is injected into the agent's context each turn — Hestia knows your devices immediately without extra MCP lookups
- Hestia's own system prompt and memory system are used; HA's generic system prompt is ignored
- Write-tool approvals are bypassed for webhook calls (no browser is available during a voice interaction)
- The sidebar polls for new voice sessions every 30 seconds and sorts them to the top as they receive new messages

---

## Memory System

Hestia uses a three-layer memory architecture so she actually remembers things:

1. **Pinned facts** (`data/MEMORY.md`) — the highest-confidence durable facts, injected into every turn. The agent can update this file directly (with your approval), and a nightly consolidation job regenerates it from the full Graphiti graph.

2. **Active recall** — before each reply, Hestia runs a fast semantic search against your Graphiti graph using your message as the query. The top results are silently injected into her context so relevant memories surface without her having to explicitly look them up.

3. **Graphiti knowledge graph** — all conversations write episodes to Graphiti. Entities and relationships accumulate over time and are visible in the 3D graph view. The nightly consolidation job prunes duplicates and promotes the best facts to the pinned layer.

To trigger consolidation manually: `POST /api/agent/consolidate`

The pinned memory file lives at `data/MEMORY.md` inside the `hestia_data` Docker volume. To inspect or edit it directly:

```bash
docker exec hestiaclaw-hestia-1 cat /app/data/MEMORY.md
```

## Skills

Skills are pre-defined agent behaviors stored as `SKILL.md` files in the `skills/` directory.

```
skills/
  morning-brief/
    SKILL.md
  lights-off/
    SKILL.md
```

**SKILL.md format:**

```markdown
---
name: morning-brief
description: Deliver a morning briefing covering overnight activity and what's on for the day.
user-invocable: true
argument-hint: (optional hint shown in the palette)
disable-model-invocation: false
---

Your instructions for the agent go here. This becomes part of the system prompt
when this skill is active.
```

**Invoking skills:**

- Type `/` in the chat input to open the command palette — navigate with arrow keys, select with Enter or Tab
- Type `/morning-brief` and send to invoke directly
- Skills with `disable-model-invocation: false` are injected into the system prompt so the model can invoke them automatically when the context matches

**Built-in slash commands:**

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/new-chat` | Start a new conversation |
| `/approvals` | Toggle tool approval prompts on/off. Also accepts `/approvals on` or `/approvals off`. State is reflected immediately in the Agent Harness panel. |

---

## Knowledge Graph

Click **KNOWLEDGE GRAPH** in the header to open the full-screen 3D force-directed view. Requires Neo4j running with `NEO4J_URI`, `NEO4J_USER`, and `NEO4J_PASSWORD` set in `.env`.

- Nodes colored by Louvain community, sized by degree centrality
- Click a node to see its relationships in the info panel
- **RECOMPUTE** re-runs the full GDS pipeline (community detection + degree centrality) server-side

As Hestia converses and queries Home Assistant, Graphiti extracts entities and builds relationships in the graph automatically — it grows on its own.
